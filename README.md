# Passw. A Python library ðŸ¦„

Passw is used for generating passwords using Python that I created! This password generator repo is more of a test of the library, I'm working on adding a bunch of cool features to Passw.

Right now I have:
* `passw.generate_password()`
* `passw.generate_letters()`
* `passw.generate_numbers()`
* `passw.generate_special_characters()`

As functions for Passw.

Full documentation and a repo of it will be released once it's done! I also aim towards publishing Passw on `pip` once the library is complete.
